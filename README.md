# SLANG
Simple Language (SLANG) is personal 
rewrite version of the lox programming language
found in the book [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
This repository contains the source code for the
slang interpreter. 

This is my first implementation of a programming
language and hence a lot of code is recycled
from the crafting interpreters book and the
dragon book. This language is more like 
Python and ES6 Javascript than the Lox 
programming language.

## NOTE: Work in progress!
